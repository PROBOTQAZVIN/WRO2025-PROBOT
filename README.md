# WRO 2025 â€“ Team ProBot | Iran (Qazvin)

This repository contains documentation for Team **ProBot (Qazvin, Iran)** participating in the **WRO 2025 Future Engineers** category.

## ðŸš— Project Overview

Our project focuses on designing and building an **autonomous vehicle robot** inspired by real-world self-driving cars. Using **LEGO EV3**, **NXT-CAM**, and RC car mechanics, the robot can navigate, detect obstacles, and make real-time decisions.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies

- LEGO Mindstorms EV3 (hardware & visual programming)
- NXT-CAM vision sensor
- Ultrasonic sensors with rotating mount
- Real-world car & RC vehicle design principles

## ðŸ‘¥ Team

- **Mentors:** Mehdi Zajkani, Ali Sadeghi  
- **Members:** Mostafa Kouchakpour, Mehrad Mirmohammadi

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Autonomous driving with precision control  
- Real-time obstacle detection & avoidance  
- Simulated environment testing  
- Future expansion using machine learning & simulation tools
